## ✨ Core Pillars

### 🧠 Narrative Intelligence
Extract the "why" behind your product. Convert technical features into customer-centric outcomes using Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) frameworks and value mapping.

### 🚀 GTM Orchestration
Plan launches from Alpha to GA with narrative-led sequencing. Ensure every channel—from website to social—speaks with one coherent voice.

### ⚔️ Sales Enablement
Equip sales teams with dynamic battle cards, win/loss pattern analysis, and objection handlers that focus on strategic differentiation.
